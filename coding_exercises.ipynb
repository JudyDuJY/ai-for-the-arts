Basic numeric operators include: +, -, *, / (floating-point division, keeping decimals), // (integer division, removing decimals), % (remainder), and ** (exponentiation). In string operations, + concatenates strings, and * repeats strings. The operator precedence is multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction; parentheses take precedence.\n",

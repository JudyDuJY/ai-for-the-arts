    "These code snippets generally function correctly if the relevant prerequisites are executed first. If they fail to execute, it's usually due to the use of undefined variables or functions, incomplete code (e.g., missing parentheses), cells not being executed sequentially in Jupyter Notebook, or indentation errors. Our discussion revealed that the code provided by Copilot is sometimes only for demonstrating the structure and not all can be executed directly; users need to complete or modify it themselves. Although the examples obtained from Copilot by different people may differ in form, they all illustrate the same concept in different ways, such as storing and outputting data through variables, reassigning values, adding user input, or demonstrating different data types. By comparing these examples, we can understand that the same program concept can be presented in multiple ways, and the key to successful program execution lies in whether the code is complete and correct."

    "## Learning Summary\n",
    "Through continuously modifying and extending the \"Hello, world!\" program, I gradually learned the fundamental programming concepts of Python and gained a clearer understanding of Python's basic structure and syntax.\n",
    "First, I learned about variables, understanding how to use `=` to store data, the differences between different data types, and how variables can be reassigned during program execution. Next, I learned the basic concepts of functions, including using `def` to define functions, the difference between parameters and arguments, and the purpose of `return` to make code more structured and reusable.\n",
    "In the area of ​​loops, I learned about `for` and `while` loops, and how Python uses indentation to determine program blocks, and how to avoid infinite loops. Afterward, I encountered various data structures, including lists, dictionaries, and arrays, and understood their different uses in storing and processing data.\n",
    "Furthermore, I learned how to import modules to extend Python's functionality and practiced using conditional statements (if/elif/else) to control program flow. I also gained a basic understanding of operators and their order of precedence.\n",
    "Finally, I had an initial introduction to object-oriented programming, learning about the concepts of categories, objects, and methods. I also learned some basic Python coding conventions and best practices, such as indentation, comments, error handling, and program conciseness and security.\n"

    "Copilot helps me transform abstract concepts into practical code examples, making it easier to understand the differences between various coding styles. Simultaneously, I test and modify the code, organizing my notes to ensure I truly understand how the program works.\n",
    "Overall, Copilot acts as a learning assistant, helping me understand fundamental Python concepts and boosting my confidence in programming."

    "Copilot provides corresponding Python implementations for the two examples I provided (a restaurant ordering system and a to-do list management system). Both programs use lists, dictionaries, and conditional statements (if/else), clearly converting the steps in the pseudocode into executable program structures, with the overall logic consistent with the original algorithm design.      \n",
    "On initial execution, both programs encountered syntax or structural issues. In the restaurant ordering system program, the final output statement was incomplete, causing the program to fail to execute; in the to-do list program, the function definition was truncated and the final else block was missing, resulting in a SyntaxError. After submitting the error messages to Copilot, it correctly identified the source of the errors and provided suggested fixes.     \n",
    "After correcting the errors, both programs run correctly on GitHub Codespaces. The restaurant ordering system can select restaurants based on user preferences and budget, create a shopping list, and output order confirmations; the to-do list program can execute tasks in high, medium, and low priority order and correctly mark task completion status.      \n",
    "After discussing with classmates, we believe these two examples effectively demonstrate the process of converting algorithms and pseudocode into Python code. The food ordering system is closer to real-world applications but has a more complex structure; the to-do list example has simpler logic and is more suitable for beginners. This exercise also made us realize that while Copilot can provide effective code suggestions, manual testing and checking are still necessary."
